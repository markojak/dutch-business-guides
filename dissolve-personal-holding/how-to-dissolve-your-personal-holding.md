# How to dissolve your personal holding

This is a simple guide explaining how to dissolve your personal holding (B.V.) in the Netherlands. You could have a personal holding to own your part of the shares in your Startup B.V., for example. Once the startup goes belly-up and you want to dissolve your personal holding as well, this guide is for you.

When dissolving any B.V., you can choose between a normale liquidation (which takes a while due to a 2 month waiting period being part of the process) and a turbo liquidation. The latter is quicker and easier and can be done in a few days or hours even. The rule of thumb is, if your holding doesn't have any benefits (anymore) you can do a turbo liquidation. If it does, you need to settle the balance and have to use a traditional liquidation. Please check with your accountant what's applicable in your case.

This guide is about a turbo liquidation,  

I do make a few assumptions:

* You are using your personal holding B.V. just as the shareholder of your actual company, e.g. you donâ€™t send any invoices, or make any costs with this B.V.
* Except from the shares of your actual company, there's no value or activity in your holding.
  * If there is, this guide can still be a good guideline, but you might need to make some changes so please check with your accountant.
* You qualify for a turbo liquidation

If any of these assumptions do not apply to your situation, please check with an accountant that knows about the Dutch tax law to advise you. If all assumptions do apply, please continue.

## What you need to do
1. Fill in [form 17a](https://www.kvk.nl/download/Formulier-17a-ontbinding-vennootschap-rechtspersoon-of-maatschap_tcm109-365610.pdf) at the KvK (Chamber of Commerce)
2. You need to have a official statement from the general assembly of shareholders (you) that you want to cease the company (your holding)
3. You need to supply a final balance sheet. You can make this yourself or ask your accountant to do so.
4. You need to add a copy of your passport or other valid means of identification, A4 sized. You can black out your photo and social security number.

All these need to be printed out, and sent to your nearest KvK office via snail mail. [Find the right address here](https://www.kvk.nl/over-de-kvk/over-het-handelsregister/postadressen/)

### 1. Fill in form 17a
It's quite a long one, but there's not that much to fill in. [Grab it from their website](https://www.kvk.nl/download/Formulier-17a-ontbinding-vennootschap-rechtspersoon-of-maatschap_tcm109-365610.pdf) and fill it in.

* 1 - name and location of your holding + the KvK ID
* 2.1 - Second checkmark, _het betreft een rechtspersoon_ (it's a legal entity) + add the date of dissolvement (which is the date you also mention in your shareholder statement, see below)
* 3.1 - Checkmark _nee_: No benefits at the moment of dissolving (_geen baten_), you can go to question 4.
* 4 - Who will keep the administration of your holding (usually you). Add your name and personal address where you will promise to store these documents. Don't forget your signature. And go to question 6 (you can skip 5)
* 6 - Checkmark _nee_. Your holding did not have any ventures.
* 7 - Add your name, the current date and your signature again
* 8 - Just to double check. You should have a checkmark at _ontbinding rechtspersoon_ (dissolvement of legal entity) and then at _nee_ (no, this is a dissolvement of a legal entity without benefits)

### 2. Statement of the general assembly of shareholders
See [the template I've used (in PDF)](template-dissolvement--statement.pdf)

You just need to add the details of your holding, the date of dissolvement and your own personal details and signature.

### 3. Final balance sheet
See [the template I've used (in PDF)](template-balance-sheet.pdf)

You might have to change some of the values here, please double check with your accountant.
