# A guide for Dutch taxes
This guide is written for (start-up) entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that need to file their tax reports. 

Right now it only contains a tutorial for doing your corporate taxes (or _vennootschapsbelasting_).

Please note that I'm not an accountant, but a business owner who wanted to crack how this works. I might have made some mistakes, so don't take anything I'm writing here as gospel. Please double check with your own accountant.
