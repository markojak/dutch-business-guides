# A guide for Dutch business stuff
This guide is written for (start-up) entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that need to handle business issues.

## Contents
1. How to do corporate taxes (_vennootschapsbelasting_)
2. How to dissolve your personal holding

## Caveat
Please note that I'm not an accountant, but a business owner who wanted to crack how this works. I might have made some mistakes, so don't take anything I'm writing here as gospel. Please double check with your own accountant.
